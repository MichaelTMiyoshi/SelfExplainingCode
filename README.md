# SelfExplainingCode
Code that explains itself when run.  C++, Java, Python, etc.  (Only C++ at first)

Sometimes I write code that I use to explain coding concepts.  The code explains the concepts and it also uses the concepts.  And sometimes other concepts are seen (and possibly explained) in the code, but not when it is running.  I call this code that explains code "Self-Explaining Code."  I know.  It is not completely explaining itself, but it does explain the main concept that I want to explain.  So since the code is self-explaining, I decided that I would make a repo that holds some of the SelfExplainingCode that I have written.  Or that I will write some day.  The first code is written in C++.  Who knows how much code I will write for this, but I think there will be a few files in here as I go through life teaching code to high school students and others.

I do just include the source code here.  No projects.  Just code.  If you want to run the code, you will need to make your own project(s) in your own IDE(s).  Then again, if the code explains itself well enough, you should not need to run the code at all.  Just be the compiler and you will see the code run in your head.
